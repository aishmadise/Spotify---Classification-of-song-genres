# Spotify-Classification-of-song-genres

Brief description of the project:

Over the past few years, streaming services with huge catalogs have become the primary means through which most people listen to their favorite music. But at the same time, the sheer amount of music on offer can mean users might be a bit overwhelmed when trying to look for newer music that suits their tastes.

For this reason, streaming services have looked into means of categorizing music to allow for personalized recommendations. One method involves direct analysis of the raw audio information in a given song, scoring the raw data on a variety of metrics. My goal is to look through this dataset and classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock'. Finally, I will predict whether I can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. 

What did I apply to this project?

1. Data manipulation using Pandas 

2. Implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, Normalization, Logistic Regression & Decision Trees using Scikit-Learn
